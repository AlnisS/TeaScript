# TeaScript
TeaScript is an interperted scripting language intended for quickly putting together high-level instructions along with doing math and data processing to control program flow while retaining an emphasis on rapid and easy script modification along with easy integration with other projects.
Check out http://teascript.bitballoon.com/ for javadoc documentation. The Action class has all of the instructions usable in a script. Check out the unit test file along with the test program file to see how to set stuff up. More documentation will come soon.
